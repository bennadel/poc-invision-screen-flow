by [Ben Nadel][bennadel]

**[Run the Proof-of-Concept Angular App][poc]** &raquo;

This is a WIP (Work in Progress) of a POC (Proof of Concept) for an InVision
App feature that I would like to pitch to the Product Team. However, I need to
get some feedback in order to even get my pitch through the door.
